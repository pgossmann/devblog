## Jekyll
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a tool to generate static pages for blogs or other content. It seems to be popular for creating github pages based blogs.

OK! So I want to try this. But there are a few things to understand and learn that I did not use before.

It requires Ruby.

## Ruby

Yeah. Always wanted to know something about [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).

## Github Pages

[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is hosting static webpages on Github. FREE for public repositories.
So create an account, create a Repo, edit the Settings and enable github pages.
Choose a theme and off you go.

## Markdown

Jekyll is using the Markdown notation to create the static HTML pages. This is cool as I wanted to have more usecases for applying Markdown.
